# Decision-Tree-Implementation

### Overview
This project provides an implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using the famous Iris dataset. The Decision Tree algorithm is used to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with each sample belonging to one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) measured in centimeters.

# Dependencies:
Python 3,
 scikit-learn, 
 pandas

# Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset iris.csv contains 150 samples with the following columns:
-> SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters
-> SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters
-> PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters
-> PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters
-> Species: The target class label (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica)

# Results:
After running the implementation, the program will output the accuracy of the Decision Tree classifier on the Iris dataset. You can modify the hyperparameters of the Decision Tree algorithm in decision_tree_iris.py to experiment with different settings.
